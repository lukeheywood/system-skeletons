# System Skeletons
### Structural blueprints for coherent systems

This repository contains **system skeletons** — reusable structural patterns for designing systems that stay coherent under load.

A skeleton is not an implementation.  
It’s the *shape* a system should have before tools are chosen.

## 🧭 What is a system skeleton?

A system skeleton defines:
- governing intent,
- primary workflows,
- boundaries,
- invariants,
- and interfaces.

It answers:
> “What must be true for this system to remain sane over time?”

## ⚠️ Structure ≠ Coherence

Good structure does not guarantee coherence.

But without structure:
- intent blurs,
- workflows multiply,
- and drift becomes inevitable.

Skeletons create the conditions for coherence to be possible.

## 🪜 Skeleton Primitives

Most skeletons here are built from:

- **Intent** — why the system exists  
- **Workflows** — how intent becomes outcomes  
- **Boundaries** — what’s inside vs outside  
- **Invariants** — what must never break  
- **Interfaces** — where humans and systems interact

## 🧱 Skeleton v0.1

The first skeleton focuses on:

- single governing intent
- multiple aligned workflows
- explicit drift prevention

Coming soon.

## 🔄 How to Adapt

Skeletons are meant to be:
- copied,
- adapted,
- and reshaped for context.

They are not prescriptions — they are starting points.

## 📊 Status

Early lab. Structure first. Patterns evolving.
